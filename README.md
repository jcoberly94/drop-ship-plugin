# bulk-drop-ship-plugin

The Problem
-WooCommerce for WordPress is great for single item product shipping, and has a wide variety of extensions for drop shipping. However, if a store owner sells products in bulk (ie casepacks), WooCommerce calculates shipping costs based off individual product dimensions, rather than casepack dimensions. This creates large errors in shipping costs and hurts sales.

The Solution
-WordPress plugin that utilizes Postmen API to gather accurate shipping costs for WooCommerce Products that are drop shipped from external locations. It allows user to specify case pack size if buyer is buying a product in bulk rather than single item purchases.
